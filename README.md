## Coding Standards

### Linter

Pyflakes is the linter. There should be no errors produced by the linter upon compilation or execution.

### Headers

Begin all programs with a description of their function. Include the programmer name(s) and date of creation for the program.

### Naming Convention

Global variables and constants should be in uppercase. Local variables and functions should be in lowercase. Word seperation should be indicated by an underscore. Names should be descriptive of their function, while also kept within a reasonable length.

### Indentation

Lines should be indented using tabs, not spaces.

### Line Breaks

Line breaks should occur before a binary operator.

Example:

```
a = b
    + c
    + d
    + ...
```
